# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  my_first_job:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Runs a single command using the runners shell
    - name: Run a one-line script
      run: echo Hello, world! >> readme.md

    # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
    - name: Run a multi-line script
      env:
        APP_NAME: Mona
      run: |
        echo Add other actions to build $APP_NAME, >> readme.md
        echo test, and deploy your project.
  my_second_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
